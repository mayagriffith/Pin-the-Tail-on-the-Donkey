# Final-Project-cplefka-mgriff13
## Pin the Tail on the Donkey made by Maya Griffith and Corinna Plefka 

### Summary of Program
Our program is a pin the tail on the donkey game using GLUT graphics. 
The program opens and you have 4 choices of either a tutorial, easy, medium, or hard game. 
The tutorial shows a picture of the donkey and where you can click to pin the tail on the donkey. 
While playing any one of the games the donkey is hidden somewhwere random on the screen and the user's cursor is the tail.
The goal is to click on the screen to find the donkey. 
The top of the screen updates with how far the user's click is from the donkey's head as well as how many tries they have left. 
Easy mode has unlimited tries, medium has 5, and hard has 3. 
The user can always return to the home screen by pressing the 'b' button. 

### Description of Contents
Our program uses many graphical elements from module 4. 
The program also contains polymorphism in the use of a button object that is a quad object, we also used I/O streams while using files to create 8-bit images. 
Polymorphism and I/O streams are contents from module 2. 

### Operating Systems + Installations 
This program was made and run on two computers that use MAC OS Catalina, so the glViewport line has it's height and width multiplied by 2 in graphics.cpp. 
There are no necessary installations needed to run this program. 

### Grading 
For our final project we believe we deserve full credit. 
We have satisfied all the design requirements of using contents from 2 modules, having user input and validating it, having a visual element, as well as including a testing suite for the non-trivial class methods. 
For execution we believe we deserve full credit for having a well documented program with no errors. 
We think our program is very clear, usable, and fun and that we deserve full credit for usability.
For complexity we believe we have earned full credit as we dedicated a lot of time towards this project and creating the specific graphics for it.
